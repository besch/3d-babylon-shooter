I want you to create a simple first person shooter game similar to Doom (DOS) or counter-strike 1.6 where you can shoot players in realtime
every player that connects to the game has to be assigned a name of a big tech company like Google, Facebook, Twitter etc.
I want  to use babylonjs (if you have in mind better alternative library then use it instead)
player has to shoot 3 times at another player to kill him
the shooting has a very big recoil
think harder to make this game interesting and interactive, the map should be awesome in cypepunk style
